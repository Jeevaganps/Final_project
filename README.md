## Problem Statement
Today Data Analysis has become a major in businesses, research, metrological department and many other fields. The extracted information from the datasets helps make meaningful decisions, publish research papers, predict weather and many more. This Spotify Data Analysis Project video will teach you to perform exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets. Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming platform with various features, including sharing songs freely and viewing the lyrics while playing the songs. You will learn to analyze, visualize and draw insights with Python libraries and functions.

# analyzing food price inflation dataset

**Introduction** : The dataset focuses on food price inflation, a key indicator for shaping economic policy. Traditional sources of consumer prices, which often face delays and only offer aggregated data during crises, may not accurately capture price trends in rural or impoverished areas. These areas are home to large populations living in fragile conditions.
The dataset comprises estimates of food prices, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of price trends that go beyond the scope of conventional measurement methods. These estimates are derived using a machine-learning algorithm that predicts ongoing subnational price surveys, frequently achieving accuracy comparable to direct price measurements. The dataset opens up new avenues for exploring local price fluctuations in regions where people are vulnerable to localized price surges and where conventional data is unavailable.  


This project aims to construct a machine learning model and implement it as a user-friendly online application in order to provide accurate predictions about the resale values of apartments in Singapore. This prediction model will be based on past transactions involving resale flats, and its goal is to aid both future buyers and sellers in evaluating the worth of a flat after it has been previously resold. Resale prices are influenced by a wide variety of criteria, including location, the kind of apartment, the total square footage, and the length of the lease. The provision of customers with an expected resale price based on these criteria is one of the ways in which a predictive model may assist in the overcoming of these obstacles.
