# analyzing food price inflation dataset

**Introduction** : The dataset focuses on food price inflation, a key indicator for shaping economic policy. Traditional sources of consumer prices, which often face delays and only offer aggregated data during crises, may not accurately capture price trends in rural or impoverished areas. These areas are home to large populations living in fragile conditions.
The dataset comprises estimates of food prices, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of price trends that go beyond the scope of conventional measurement methods. These estimates are derived using a machine-learning algorithm that predicts ongoing subnational price surveys, frequently achieving accuracy comparable to direct price measurements. The dataset opens up new avenues for exploring local price fluctuations in regions where people are vulnerable to localized price surges and where conventional data is unavailable.
